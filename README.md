## what does it do?
Program reads data from excel sheet, puts them in a txt file then compares them with a new file containing all known
customers in the database. if a customers name does not appear in the database it will be kept in the array the array
is then written to a txt file. this helps speed up the data entry process by hours and allows for customers to not be
missed.
